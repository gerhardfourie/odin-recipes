            <li>1 large carrot, roughly chopped into 3cm pieces</li>
            <li>1 stick celery, roughly chopped into 3cm pieces</li>
            <li>5 small rosemary sprigs, cut in half, widthwise</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, peeled, left whole</li>
            <li>60ml (1/4 cup) olive oil</li>
            <li>200g baby green beans, trimmed</li>
            <li>200g yellow beans (butter), trimmed</li>
            <li>50g butter</li>
            <li>Sourdough bread, to serve</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200C. To roast lamb, scatter onion carrot and celery over the base of a large roasting pan. Place lamb seem-side down.</li>
            <li>Using a small paring knife make fifteen shallow incisions scattered all over the top of the rolled lamb loin roast; taking care not to cut the kitchen string. Stuff rosemary and garlic into each incision. Drizzle with oil and roast for 1Â¼ hours or until cooked to you liking. Rest for 15 minutes before carving, to serve.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook beans in a saucepan of boiling salted water for 3 minutes or until cooked but still with a crunch. Drain and place in a large bowl with butter. Season to taste.</li>
            <li>To serve, Divide beans among four plates and top with carved lamb. Serve with sourdough bread on the side.    </li>
        </ol>
